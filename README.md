# js-hello-world-mre

This is a clone of the [hello-world](https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk-samples) MRE sample from Microsoft that does not use Typescript.

Functionally it is identical, the purpose is a starting point for those that dislike Typescript and prefer using vanilla Javascript.

This project does not need a typescript compiler and does not need to be built. You can start it directly either with `node server.js` or `npm start`.
